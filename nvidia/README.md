# Nvidia: Jetson Nano Developer Kit

NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts.

It’s simpler than ever to get started! Just insert a microSD card with the system image, boot the developer kit, and begin using the same [NVIDIA JetPack SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) used across the entire [NVIDIA Jetson™ family of products](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware). 

JetPack is compatible with NVIDIA’s world-leading AI platform for training and deploying AI software, reducing complexity and effort for developers.
